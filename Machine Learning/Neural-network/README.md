# Neural Network
## Descriptions:
This is the Neural-Network model approach to classify CIFAR-10 dataset
## How to use and notes:
- Run the program
- This folder need CIFAR-10 folder inside to work.
- Used neural network with Keras to build the Neural-Networks.
- Trial and errors to find appropriate parameters and good average output.
