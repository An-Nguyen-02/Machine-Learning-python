This folder contains all the Machine Learning I have implemented in a course at school.</br>
The code I implemented are gathered by knowledge and online searching as well.</br>
If the sub-folders have CIFAR in the name, it needs CIFAR-10 dataset as a folder in it.</br>
CIFAR-10 dataset can be found at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
