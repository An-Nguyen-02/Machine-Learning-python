# Machine Learning with Python
## Description:
This folder contains all the Machine Learning I have implemented in a course at school. The code I implemented are gathered by knowledge and online searching as well.</br>
## How to use:
Install needed import packages and run the program normally.
## Notes:
- If the sub-folders have CIFAR in the name, it needs CIFAR-10 dataset as a folder in it.</br>
- CIFAR-10 dataset can be found at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
- Some programs may take a lot of time (up to hours) because I built it so they're not optimized.
